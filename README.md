# Data Professional Survey Analysis

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of survey data from **630 data professionals** across various roles, countries, and skill levels. Using **Power BI**, we explored key metrics like salary distributions, programming language preferences, and work-life satisfaction to provide actionable insights into the current state of the data profession.

### Key Findings
#### 1. Participant Demographics:

* **Average Age**: 29.87 years
* **Countries Represented**: United States, Canada, India, United Kingdom, and others.

#### 2. Job Roles and Salaries: *Respondents included professionals in roles such as:*
- Data Scientist
- Data Architect
- Data Engineer
- Data Analyst
- Database Developer
- Students/Job Seekers

#### 3. Salary highlights:
- **Data Architects** reported the highest average salaries, followed by **Data Engineers** and **Data Scientists**.
- **Data Analysts** and **Database Developers** showcased competitive but lower salary averages.

#### 4. Programming Language Preferences:

 - **Python** is the clear favorite programming language among professionals.
- Other notable languages include **R**, **JavaScript**, **C/C++**, and **Java**.
- A smaller percentage of respondents indicated preference for other programming languages.
